## The Challenge
This application was developed as part of a coding challenge to create a Kotlin application using the Cat API (https://thecatapi.com/). The objective was to implement a user-friendly interface with various functionalities related to cat breeds.

## Application Features
1. **Cat Breeds List**: Displays a list of cat breeds with images and breed names.
2. **Search Functionality**: A search bar to filter the cat breeds by name.
3. **Favorite Breeds**: Users can mark breeds as favorites.
4. **Favorites Screen**: A dedicated screen to show all favorite breeds, including the average lifespan of these breeds.
5. **Detailed View**: Users can access detailed information about each breed, including:
   - Breed Name
   - Origin
   - Temperament
   - Description
   - A button to add/remove the breed from favorites.
6. **Navigation**: Utilizes Jetpack Navigation Component for seamless navigation between screens.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Kotlin
- **Frameworks**: Jetpack Compose and Room
- **Networking**: Retrofit for API calls
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin
- **Concurrency**: Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- **Image Loading**: Coil for image loading in the UI

## Development
The project was developed using multiple commits to document the thought process and progress throughout the challenge. Each commit reflects the evolving functionalities and improvements made to the application.

## Getting Started
